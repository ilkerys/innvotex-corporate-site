## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a dynamic, secure, and fully responsive corporate website built for **Innvotex**, a textile machinery and consulting company.

Unlike static websites, this application features a **custom-built Content Management System (CMS)**, allowing the business owner to manage blogs, media galleries, FAQs, and incoming messages without touching a single line of code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Database:** SQLite (Lightweight & Fast)
* **Server:** GoDaddy Shared Hosting (cPanel) running via **Phusion Passenger**
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 Templates, JavaScript

* **Localization:** Multi-language infrastructure (TR/EN/FR).
* **Performance:** Optimized media serving and database queries for shared resources.
